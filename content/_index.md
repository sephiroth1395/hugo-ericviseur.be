### Cybersecurity Architect | Head of Security Discipline @ [Thales Belgium](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/countries/europe/thales-belgium) 🇧🇪

_Leader of the Cybersecurity Engineering team in the Belgian Defense & Security entity of a major European industrial actor_

🧩 **Life was always about bringing things together in unconventional ways for me.**

🏰 As a kid, I spent countless hours bringing together LEGO kits that had no business being close to each other into massive anachronistic citadels where epic stories played out. 

🚀 When my passion for computer networks emerged, this turned into integrating software in ways that were definitely not foreseen by developers to meet new purposes. I don’t consider myself to be a good software engineer, but give me Bash scripts and enough time, and we’ll go to the moon with a dishwasher and three screwdrivers. 

📡 As a System Engineer then Architect, I honed those skills into capturing user needs, designing critical communications & cybersecurity solutions and accompanying the technical teams into successful development, integration and validation of the resulting solutions. Through my pivotal role in setting up a 24x7 service structure, I also learned the value of customer intimacy and the difference between efficiency and exasperation. 

📈 **Having moved to Head of Discipline, my focus is now empowerment: making sure the team grows in size and skills in a positive, empathetic and intellectually challenging environment, reaching even higher heights than what my decade as a System Architect got me to.**
